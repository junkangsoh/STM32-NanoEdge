## About Project
To obtain the vibration patterns of the table fan, a STM board, L432KC and an accelerometer, LIS3DSH are used in this project. This project is divided into two parts that are data logging and class detection. 

👀 Here are the paths to the source codes.

[Code for Data Logging 🙂](https://github.com/junkangsoh/STM32-NanoEdge/blob/main/Logging/main.c)<br/>[Code for Class Detection 😊](https://github.com/junkangsoh/STM32-NanoEdge/blob/main/Detection/main.c)<br/>[Required Libraries 😯](https://github.com/junkangsoh/STM32-NanoEdge/blob/main/Inc)
